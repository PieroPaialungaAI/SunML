# Convolutional Neural Networks for binary classification of SolarÂ Flares
The Sun is the most important star for our planet, as it permits to have life as we know it. One of the most important phenomena of Sun magnetical activity is the one of the  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare}{Solar Flares}.    

## The Challenge

As it has been said that the cycles are 22 years long, it would be really helpful to know in advance if we actually will have a very active sun in our next cycle or if the situation will be "easier". Nonetheless, we have already said that the Sun is not that easy to model, and it is becoming really hard to believe to get a physical analitical formula that permits to compute what the hell is happening in that huge ball of gas. So the idea is to __use Machine Learning to extract the statistical information about the next solar cycle__.
