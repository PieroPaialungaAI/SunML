_Hello you! This is my project about Convolutional Neural Networks for binary classification of Solar Flares. If you are interested in the general project and want to know how technology can help astrophysics without any knowledge domain, please go ahead and read chapter 1.
If you are not interested in the theoretical background of this project, but want to know more about Python, AI and Machine Learning techniques, please skip the first part and move to chapter 2 to discover how to move in the repository and reproduce the compuational experiment.
If you are interested in both you are just perfect. :) 
Get an idea of what is the idea of the project in chapter 1, and deepen the computational effort and challenges in chapter 2. 
Welcome aboard,skipper._ 

## 1. About the project

The Sun is the most important star for our planet, as it permits to have life as we know it. One of the most important phenomena of Sun magnetical activity is the one of the  [Solar Flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare). These are sudden flashes, often seen in the proximity of sunspot and accompanied by enormous energy ejection (coronal mass ejections). Coronal mass ejections can have crucial effects on our lives as radio communication or damage to satellites (or people if we are unlucky) during space missions. The detection and the analysis of solar flares is thus an important task and a necessary effort.\\
Sofisticated techniques have been developed to determine, predict and analyze Solar Flares. Nonetheless the challenge of this GitHub repository is to classify whether or not there is a solar flare in the Sun right now without having any domain knowledge that can cost lot of money and require years of study. 



## The Challenge
The challenge of this GitHub Repository is to perform a __binary classification directly on Solar Magnetogram images__, without having no additional information about the Sun magnetic behavior.

## The tool 
The tool that have been used during this process is the one of most powerful algorithm that is called Convolutional Neural Network. \\
This algorithm analyzes each pixel of the image and build a network of parameters that converges to a single number that is the probability of that image to belong to one class. 
In this particular
