# Here comes the Sun, literally, with Machine Learning 
The Sun is the most important star for our planet, as it permits to have life as we know. Like the Earth, the Sun has its own magnetic cycle, and after a certain period (22 years) the magnetical behavior changes. Nonetheless, even if we know we can model the Earth magnetical properties with two single poles, a north and a sud, the magnetical properties of the Sun are not that simple, and the magnetical properties of the Sun are a deep study topic. \\
