The Sun is the most important star for our planet, as it permits to have life as we know it. One of the most important phenomena of Sun magnetical activity is the one of the  [Solar Flares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_flare). These are sudden flashes, often seen in the proximity of sunspot and accompanied by enormous energy ejection (coronal mass ejections). Coronal mass ejections can have crucial effects on our lives as radio communication or damage to satellites (or people if we are unlucky) during space missions. The detection and the analysis of solar flares is thus an important task and a necessary effort.\\
Sofisticated techniques have been developed to determine, predict and analyze Solar Flares. Nonetheless the challenge of this GitHub repository is to classify whether or not there is a solar flare in the Sun right now without having any domain knowledge that can cost lot of money and require years of study. 



## The Challenge
The challenge of this GitHub Repository is to perform a __binary classification directly on Solar Magnetogram images__, without having no additional information about the Sun magnetic behavior.
