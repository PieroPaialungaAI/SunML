# Here comes the Sun, literally, with Machine Learning 
The Sun is the most important star for our planet, as it permits to have life as we know it. Like the Earth, the Sun has its own magnetic cycle, and after a certain period (22 years) the magnetical behavior changes. Nonetheless, even if we know we can model the Earth magnetical properties with two single poles, a north and a sud, the magnetical properties of the Sun are not that simple, and the magnetical properties of the Sun are a deep study topic. Anyway, this is not "just" out of  curiosity. In fact, when the Sun is particularly magnetically active in its cicle, dangerous physical phenomena happen, and they can disturb our communication system or destroy the satellites (if we are lucky and they don't hurt people). 

## The Challenge

As it has been said that the cycles are 22 years long, it would be really helpful to know in advance if we actually will have a very active sun in our next cycle or if the situation will be "easier". Nonetheless, we have already said that the Sun is not that easy to model, and it is becoming really hard to believe to get a physical analitical formula that permits to compute what the hell is happening in that huge ball of gas. So the idea is to __use Machine Learning to extract the statistical information about the next solar cycle__.
